HTML
- Valid HTML: HTML5 semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section> , etc. are used to add meaning to the code, No div or section selectors are without a CSS class or id
- All code is lowercase
- The code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it is acceptable to put all elements in one line).
- When quoting attribute values, code uses consistent quotation marks (single vs. double)
- HTML documents HTML5 <!doctype html>
- Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.
- Optional: Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces)

CSS
- The code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
- The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.
- Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.
- Code always uses a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block. Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
- Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
- Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).
- The code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible, but as long as necessary.
- The code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.
- The code uses shorthand properties where possible.
- Optional: Code omits unit specification after 0 values.
- Optional: Code includes leading 0s in decimal values for readability.
- Optional: Code uses 3-character hexadecimal notation where possible.
- Optional: Code separates words in ID and class names by a hyphen.

SUGGESTIONS:
- Custom Text: You are welcome to use Lorem ipsum or other placeholder text in your blog and blog posts, but putting in real, custom text can make your project look even more impressive!
- Pattern - Related Articles: Add 2 to 3 fake blog post references after the blog post ends (i.e. to older blog posts)
- Pattern - Subscribe Form: Instead of a fake subscribe link on the blog, there is an actual form area with name and email input fields and a subscribe button.
- Project URL: Project is fully deployed on GitHub Pages, Netlify or another hosting provider that is free of charge.
- Design System: Consider implementing a design system(opens in a new tab) for your webpage.
- Accessibility:
  * Discernable text
  * Sufficient color contrast
  * ARIA attributes
  * Less than 5 violations found through the Axe(opens in a new tab) (Chrome extension) test on the web page.
